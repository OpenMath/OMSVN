<h2>The <i>key</i> technology to open mathematics to the world</h2>
</center>

<p>As decided in Linz during the OpenMath meeting, the graphical
group of the Explo-IT Research, directed by <a
href="mailto:mottola@Explo-IT.com">Andrea Mottola</a>, has realized
a new logo for the OpenMath Project. Based on the idea of combining
the <b>O</b> and the <b>M</b> of OpenMath to draw a key, the new
OpenMath logo is available in the following three formats.</p>

<h3>1. A large gif (354x851)</h3>

<p><img src="./OpenMath354x851.gif"
alt="OpenMath logo - large" /></p>

<h3>2. A medium gif (200x481)</h3>

<p><img src="./OpenMath200x481.gif"
alt="OpenMath logo - medium" /></p>

<h3>3. A small "Powered by OpenMath" gif (800x32), to be used to
reference www.openmath.org</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.openmath.org"><img border="0"
src="./poweredByOpenMath1.gif" alt="Powered by OpenMath" /></a></p>
