*&** OpenMath WebSite Journal File ****
*** write here what you did and why ***

==== 2006-01-11 Mark Spanbroek ====
Changed build script such that it now always uses the included xalan xstl 
processor. The build script should now work out-of-the-box with the 5.0 jdk.


==== 2005-12-08 Paul L ====
Created this file.
Noted missing URL:
    http://openmath.activemath.org/cdfiles/cdgroups/mathml.cdg
but cdg files seem also to be found inside the standards... should I move them ?

==== Things to be done for the website ====

- Make it work with a bundled xalan.jar to ensure portability to any java
- absolute pointers to openmath.org/cds/xxx.ocd (or openmath.org/contribs/cds/xxx.ocd)
  should be made to relative pointers by XSLT so that we can build without a connection!

Qs:
- the toolbar points to /cocoon.... I'd rather have relative links in order to be able to test on file-paths
- links to community-pages about the CDs.
- pages about phrasebook compatibility (a version of which included in the wiki??)
  (for each CD, for each symbol, a comment)
  
======== 2006-04-13 Paul L ========================
Things are horribly late.
Mike D reports some wrong links to STS files in CD-lists...
discussion of a fix and applied, still assuming Saxon is on.

Also made the CD-list not pre-formatted... makes the list more digestable!

Use the file-detection trick to avoid the very many error-reports because
of missing documents.
Now checked using a link-checker (used link-verify.sourceforge.net, simple and straight).

A few results:
- binaries were almost all missing... still a few... 
    have to go through the original archive of David
- why does list1.xhtml only present a raw source ??
- link to hypergeo0 from hypergeo1 is wrong... why ?

====== 2006-04-16 Paul L ==========================
- most binaries fixed but some seem missing from the original... 
  have to live with that for now
- link-verify output is in 
    xml/link-verify-report.txt (hence at 
        http:///om-candidate.activemath.org/link-verify-report.txt)
  several broken links should now be fixed as I made the build's copy
  more flexible.
- still a few weird links (list1.xhtml, link from hypergeo0 to hypergeo1...)
Will go to request approval... I think this is acceptable now.

============ 2006-06-09 Paul L =====================
Oh... cd-groups are not downloadable...
    http://www.openmath.org/cdfiles/cdgroups/mathml.cdg
is 404.
Also, some CDG such files are in the standards and seem to indicate that their URL is ocd!
