<h2>The <i>key</i> technology to open mathematics to the world</h2>
</center>

<p>
As decided in Linz during the OpenMath meeting, the graphical group of the 
Explo-IT Research, directed by
<a href="mailto:mottola@Explo-IT.com">Andrea Mottola</a>, 
has realized a new logo for the OpenMath Project.
Based on the idea of combining the <b>O</b> and the <b>M</b> of OpenMath to draw a key, the
new OpenMath logo is available in the following three formats.
</p>

<h3>1. A large gif (354x85)</h3>
<p><img src="./OpenMath354x85.gif" alt="OpenMath logo - large"/></p>
<h3>2. A medium gif (200x48)</h3>
<p><img src="./OpenMath200x48.gif" alt="OpenMath logo - medium"/></p>
<h3>3. A small "Powered by OpenMath" gif (88x32), to be used to reference www.openmath.org</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.openmath.org" target="_top"><img border="0" src="./poweredByOpenMath.gif" alt="Powered by OpenMath"/></a></p>
