<page-title> OpenMath Website Build System </page-title>

<p>The OpenMath website, including its CDs, is built from files in a
Subversion repository using the Apache Ant system and a build.xml
stored in the subversion.</p>
<p>Many pages are simple XML pages transformed to HTML using
 stylesheets/html/om-page.xsl .</p>
<p>To be continued.</p>

<h3>How to add a contributed CD</h3>
<p>Contributed CDs are submitted as Jira issues in 
  <link uri="http://jira.activemath.org/browse/OM">Jira's OM project</link>.
  Someone gets the notification per mail and can download the CD,
  inspect it, validate it (is it XML-validating, does it make sense,
  does it render well, ...).</p>
<p>Once it's ready it is saved in <link uri="https://github.com/OpenMath/OMSVN/blob/master/www/cdfiles2/contrib/cd"
  >www/cdfiles2/contrib/cd</link>.
  Then also add a entry into the 
   <link uri="https://github.com/OpenMath/OMSVN/blob/master/www/cdfiles2/contrib/log.xml"
  >www/cdfiles2/contrib/log.xml</link>.</p>
<p>Only close the issue with appropriate rendering on the website
  that can be given by a URL.</p>
<p>TODO: this should also trigger a message into the log of announces.</p>
