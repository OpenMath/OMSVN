<page-title> Subversion for the OpenMath Website </page-title>

<p>The OpenMath website, including its CDs, is built from files in a
Subversion repository. The repository is publicly readable but need
credentials to commit.</p>

<p align="center"><link uri="http://svn.openmath.org/OpenMath/">http://svn.openmath.org/OpenMath/</link></p>

<p>... is the URL of that repository. This URL can be used by normal web-browsers
to see the current state of trunk.</p>

<p>Subversion is a widespread versioning system which has multiple implementations
from desktop integrated ones 
(<link uri="http://scplugin.tigris.org/">SCplugin</link>,
<link uri="http://tortoisesvn.org/">TortoiseSVN</link>)
till application based (<link uri="http://rapidsvn.tigris.org/">RapidSVN</link>,
<link uri="http://versionsapp.com/">Versions.app</link>); it is also
common in development environments. Users can
checkout a copy, perform local changes, publish their changes, update
their copies.</p>

<p>Write access is gained by submitting credentials to
<link uri="mailto:paul@activemath.org">paul@activemath.org</link>
in the form of an htpasswd output:
htpasswd -n &lt;username&gt;</p>

<p>The website is built by an ant file, explained in the
<link uri="website-build.html">website-build</link> triggered
latest one hour after a commit. This build is run with a "normal ant"
with the addition of the saxon jar so that XSLT 2 and/or Saxon extensions can run.
Those who wish to adjust the website are encouraged to checkout
only the "non-mass" part of it, since the "mass" part of it
is made of many static resources such as slide' copies. The non-mass
part is in the directory www. </p>
