<page-title> Git for the OpenMath Website </page-title>

<p>The OpenMath website, including its CDs, is built from files in a
<link uri="https://github.com/">GitHub</link> git repository. The repository is publicly readable but needs
credentials to commit.</p>

<p align="center"><link uri="https://github.com/OpenMath/OMSVN">https://github.com/OpenMath/OMSVN</link></p>

<p>... is the URL of that repository. GitHub also provides a Subversion interface at</p>

<p align="center"><link uri="https://github.com/OpenMath/OMSVN/trunk">https://github.com/OpenMath/OMSVN/trunk</link></p>

<p>... which can be used by subversion clients to checkout the repository. </p>

<p>Write access is gained by being added to the github organisation. Alternatively, one can use the standard GitHub workflow of <link uri="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/">making pull requests</link>. 
</p>

<p>The website is built by an ant file, explained in the
<link uri="website-build.html">website-build</link> triggered
latest one hour after a commit. This build is run with a "normal ant"
with the addition of the saxon jar so that XSLT 2 and/or Saxon extensions can run.
Those who wish to adjust the website are encouraged to checkout
only the "non-mass" part of it, since the "mass" part of it
is made of many static resources such as slide' copies. The non-mass
part is in the directory www. </p>
