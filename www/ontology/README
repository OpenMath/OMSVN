This is the OpenMath CD ontology, an OWL implementation of the
abstract OpenMath CD specification (OpenMath 2 standard, section 4.2).
It is intended to make the structures of OpenMath CDs accessible to
Semantic Web and Linked Data tools.

== Motivation ==

This ontology is intended to represent knowledge from OpenMath CDs in
a way that â€¦

* is compliant with the abstract CD specification
* abstracts from the XML syntax of the CD language
* captures more of the semantics of the CD language than the Relax NG
  XML schema is capable of

The ontology is currently being used as a vocabulary for publishing
the OpenMath CDs as Linked Open Data; see
http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.4057 for background.  For a complete
coverage of the design of the ontology, see Christoph Lange's
Ph.D. thesis (https://svn.kwarc.info/repos/swim/doc/phd/phd.pdf).
Previously, the ontology has been utilised internally by the OpenMath
CD wiki, which used to be online at http://wiki.openmath.org but is no longer
maintained now.

== Status ==

The current state (version 0.3.2 as of 2011-02-14) covers most of the
OpenMath 2 abstract CD model.  Additionally, it includes notation
dictionaries as planned for OpenMath 2+/3.  It does not currently
cover any representation of OpenMath objects.  Further development
will be done towards OpenMath 2+/3.

== Files ==

The *.n3 file is the authoritative source.  The *.owl file (RDF/XML)
is generated from that.  The N3 syntax is easier to author for humans,
whereas RDF/XML is more widely supported by software.  rdfcat from
Jena (http://jena.sourceforge.net) is a tool that can do this
conversion:

$ rdfcat -out RDF/XML -n openmath.n3 > openmath.owl

== Usage ==

You can use this ontology in conjunction with OpenMath CDs or without.
If used together with CDs, we recommend using the Krextor library
(http://kwarc.info/projects/krextor/) for extracting RDF in terms of
this ontology from your XML CD files.  If used without CD files, the
ontology can serve as an alternative language for representing (part
of) the knowledge that can be captured in CDs.
