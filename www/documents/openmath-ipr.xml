Dictionaries were developed under an EU ESPRIT project
<a href="http://cordis.europa.eu/projects/rcn/38330_en.html">http://cordis.europa.eu/projects/rcn/38330_en.html</a>
in which all materials and any underlying patent licenses that may be required
were made available by project members on a Royalty Free
basis as part of the contract terms of that project.</li>

<li>The OpenMath 2 standard and the updated Core Content Dictionaries were
developed under the EU funded OpenMath Thematic network
<a href="http://cordis.europa.eu/projects/rcn/60953_en.html">http://cordis.europa.eu/projects/rcn/60953_en.html</a>
