<h2>Notes:</h2>

<ul>

<li>This version of the OpenMath Royalty Free License policy was put in
place by the OpenMath Society  on 2013-12-01 however it also applies to
the existing OpenMath Standard and Content Dictionaries.</li>

<li>The OpenMath 1 standard (2000) and most of the core Content
Dictionaries were developed under an EU ESPRIT project
<a href="http://cordis.europa.eu/projects/rcn/38330_en.html">http://cordis.europa.eu/projects/rcn/38330_en.html</a>
in which all materials and any underlying patent licenses that may be required
were made available by project members on a Royalty Free
basis as part of the contract terms of that project.</li>

<li>The OpenMath 2 standard and the updated Core Content Dictionaries were
developed under the EU funded OpenMath Thematic network
<a href="http://cordis.europa.eu/projects/rcn/60953_en.html">http://cordis.europa.eu/projects/rcn/60953_en.html</a>
All contributions under this project were made available under Royalty
Free basis, and Copyright assigned to the OpenMath Society.</li>

<li>Contributed Content Dictionaries: 
Currently (2013-12-01) not all Contributed Content Dictionaries have an explicit license statement.<br/>
Authors will be contacted and if, by 31-03-2015, there are any Content Dictionaries that do not have a license
compatible with this policy, they will be moved from
<a href="http://www.openmath.org/cd/contrib/">http://www.openmath.org/cd/contrib/</a> to a new
<code>http://www.openmath.org/cd/contrib.nonfree/</code> area.
