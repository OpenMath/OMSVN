1999-02-13  Richard Timoney

	* cd/minmax.ocd:
	Removed idea that min and max could be applied to sets.
	
	* cd/limit.ocd: Removed tendsto, added null symbol.
  	Note the equivalence to MathML tendsto in the exampl

	* cd/nums.ocd: The symbols true and false are moved to the logic
	cd.

	variables sensibly.
	Removed reference to nonexistant elements construct.
	Rephrased and corrected descriptions.
	Standard deviation and variance now defined correctly for sample
	data, whereas previous definition was corect for a list of
	equiprobable values of a random variable.
	Original based on MathML, which refers for sdev to CRC Standard
	Mathematical Tables and Formulae, editor: Dan Zwillinger, CRC
	Press Inc., 1996, [7.1.2] and [7.7].
