This is the OpenMath document ontology, a vocabulary for structures
from OpenMath Content Dictionaries (CDs) that is suitable for use with
Semantic Web tools.

== Motivation ==

This ontology is intended to represent knowledge from OpenMath CDs in
a way that abstracts from the XML syntax of the CD language.
Furthermore, it captures more of the semantics of the CD language than
the Relax NG XML schema is capable of.

The ontology is currently utilised internally by the OpenMath CD wiki
at http://wiki.openmath.org.  Using it for publishing the OpenMath CDs
as Linked Open Data, and interlinking them with other datasets on the
Web of Data, is planned; see http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.4057.  For a
complete coverage of the design of the ontology, see Christoph Lange's
Ph.D. thesis (https://svn.kwarc.info/repos/swim/doc/phd/phd.pdf).

== Status ==

The current state (version 0.3.1 as of 2010/08/21) covers most of the
OpenMath 2 abstract CD model.  Additionally, it includes notation
dictionaries as planned for OpenMath 2+/3.  It does not currently
cover any representation of OpenMath objects.  Further development
will be done towards OpenMath 2+/3.

== Files ==

The *.n3 file is the authoritative source.  The *.owl file (RDF/XML)
is generated from that.  The N3 syntax is easier to author for humans,
whereas RDF/XML is more widely supported by software.  rdfcat from
Jena (http://jena.sourceforge.net) is a tool that can do this
conversion:

$ rdfcat -out RDF/XML -n openmath.n3 > openmath.owl

== Usage ==

You can use this ontology in conjunction with OpenMath CDs or without.
If used together with CDs, we recommend using the Krextor library
(http://kwarc.info/projects/krextor/) for extracting RDF in terms of
this ontology from your XML CD files.  If used without CD files, the
ontology can serve as an alternative language for representing (part
of) the knowledge that can be captured in CDs.
