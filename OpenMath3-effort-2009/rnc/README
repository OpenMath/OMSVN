This directory contains the MathML3 RelaxNG schema. 

Formats:
======

RNC: The files *.rnc make up the Schema in compact notation, they are the original, 
         all other's are generated, and should not be edited manually
RNG: The RelaxNG Schema in XML notation, generated.
XSD: The RelaxNG Schema in XML Schema notation, generated.

Files:
====

mathml3.*
           is the top-level file, it sets up some attributes and includes the other files
mathml3-presentation.*
           contains the rules for  presentation MathML
mathml3-strict.*
           contains the rules for canonical content MathML
mathml3-pragmatic.*
          extends the content MathML grammar to allow pragmatic content MathML. 
mathml3-cds.*
          contains the rules for CD-defined content MathML token elements

TESTING:
======

the file test.xml has a copy of the examples from the pragmatic CMathML part of the spec
(keep up to date via diff) organized in pairs. by runnign the conversion style sheet over
the left hand side, we should get the right hand side.

test.rnc is the RelaxNG grammar for test.rnc (used to test the pCMathML grammar). 


TODO:
====

1) test on many examples
2) maybe modularize mathml3-cds into single cd files; maybe these can be generated from
    the signature declarations in the *.mcd files. 
3) check that we got  the pragmatic part right
4) modularize the presentation part. 
5) define driver files of varying strictness
6) get all the pattern definitions right
