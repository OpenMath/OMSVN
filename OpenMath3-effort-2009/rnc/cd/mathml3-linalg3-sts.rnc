     The copyright holder grants you permission to redistribute this 
     document freely as a verbatim copy. Furthermore, the copyright
     holder permits you to develop any derived work from this document
     provided that the following conditions are met.
       a) The derived work acknowledges the fact that it is derived from
          this document, and maintains a prominent reference in the 
          work to the original source.
       b) The fact that the derived work is not the original OpenMath 
          document is stated prominently in the derived work.  Moreover if
          both this document and the derived work are Content Dictionaries
          then the derived work must include a different CDName element,
          chosen so that it cannot be confused with any works adopted by
          the OpenMath Society.  In particular, if there is a Content 
          Dictionary Group whose name is, for example, `math' containing
          Content Dictionaries named `math1', `math2' etc., then you should 
          not name a derived Content Dictionary `mathN' where N is an integer.
          However you are free to name it `private_mathN' or some such.  This
          is because the names `mathN' may be used by the OpenMath Society
          for future extensions.
       c) The derived work is distributed under terms that allow the
          compilation of derived works, but keep paragraphs a) and b)
          intact.  The simplest way to do this is to distribute the derived
          work under the OpenMath license, but this is not a requirement.
     If you have questions about this license please contact the OpenMath

  This content dictionary treats matrices and vectors in a column oriented fashion (using matrix columns). Vectors in this CD are considered to be column vectors and must therefore be transposed to be considered as row vectors.

        The type attribute can be used to explicitly specify that a
      vector is a "row" vector.
      
    
    application
    A vector is an ordered n-tuple of values representing an element of an n-dimensional vector space. The "values" are all from the same ring, typically real or complex. Where orientation is important, such as for pre or post multiplication by a matrix a vector is treated as a column vector and its transpose is treated a row vector. See CRC Standard Mathematical Tables and Formulae, editor: Dan Zwillinger, CRC Press Inc., 1996, [2.4]

    
      For purposes of interaction with matrices and matrix multiplication, vectors are
      regarded as equivalent to a matrix consisting of a single column, and the transpose
      of a vector behaves the same as a matrix consisting of a single row. Note that
      vectors may be rendered either as a single column or row.

      The vector element constructs vectors from an n-dimensional
      vector space so that its n child elements typically represent real or
      complex valued scalars as in the three-element vector

      A vector can also be constructed by evaluating a function over a specific domain
       of application, each evaluation corresponding to an entry in the vector.  In its
       most general form a domain is explicitly specified by a
       domainofapplication element and a function. Optionally the
       domainofapplication can be augmented by a bvar element and an
       algebraic expression expressed in terms of it.  Qualifications defined by a
       domainofapplication element can be abbreviated in several ways as
       described in .

        Note that the behavior of the matrix and matrixrow elements is
    substantially different from the mtable and mtr presentation
    elements.
      
    
    application
    This is the constructor for a matrix. It takes an arbitrary number matrix rows as arguments. It is used to represent matrices. See CRC Standard Mathematical Tables and Formulae, editor: Dan Zwillinger, CRC Press Inc., 1996, [2.5.1].

    
      The matrix element is used to represent mathematical matrices. It has zero
    or more child elements, all of which are matrixrow elements. These in turn
    expect zero or more child elements that evaluate to algebraic expressions or
    numbers. These sub-elements are often real numbers, or symbols as in

    The matrixrow elements must always be contained inside of a matrix, and all
    rows in a given matrix must have the same number of elements.
