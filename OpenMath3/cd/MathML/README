This space is the main development ground for the OpenMath3/Mathml3 Content Dictionaries (CDs). 

The new CDs are based mostly on the OpenMath2 CDs (*.ocd) with additions for
MathML (incorporated into *.ocd). 
We also have type information   (*.sts, *.mts) and a new notation definition system (*.ntn also from *.mts).  

The RelaxNG schema will be developed at ../../rnc.
