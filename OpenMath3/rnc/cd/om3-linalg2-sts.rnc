     The copyright holder grants you permission to redistribute this 
     document freely as a verbatim copy. Furthermore, the copyright
     holder permits you to develop any derived work from this document
     provided that the following conditions are met.
       a) The derived work acknowledges the fact that it is derived from
          this document, and maintains a prominent reference in the 
          work to the original source.
       b) The fact that the derived work is not the original OpenMath 
          document is stated prominently in the derived work.  Moreover if
          both this document and the derived work are Content Dictionaries
          then the derived work must include a different CDName element,
          chosen so that it cannot be confused with any works adopted by
          the OpenMath Society.  In particular, if there is a Content 
          Dictionary Group whose name is, for example, `math' containing
          Content Dictionaries named `math1', `math2' etc., then you should 
          not name a derived Content Dictionary `mathN' where N is an integer.
          However you are free to name it `private_mathN' or some such.  This
          is because the names `mathN' may be used by the OpenMath Society
          for future extensions.
       c) The derived work is distributed under terms that allow the
          compilation of derived works, but keep paragraphs a) and b)
          intact.  The simplest way to do this is to distribute the derived
          work under the OpenMath license, but this is not a requirement.
     If you have questions about this license please contact the OpenMath
     society at http://www.openmath.org.

  draft
  This content dictionary treats matrices and vectors in a row oriented fashion (using matrix rows). Vectors in this CD are considered to be row vectors and must therefore be transposed to be considered as column vectors.

        "column"
      
      
        The type attribute can be used to explicitly specify that a
      vector is a "column" vector.
      
    
    application
    A vector is an ordered n-tuple of values representing an element of an n-dimensional vector space. The "values" are all from the same ring, typically real or complex. Where orientation is important, such as for pre or post multiplication by a matrix a vector is treated as a row vector and its transpose is treated a column vector. See CRC Standard Mathematical Tables and Formulae, editor: Dan Zwillinger, CRC Press Inc., 1996, [2.4]

    
      For purposes of interaction with matrices and matrix multiplication, vectors are
      regarded as equivalent to a matrix consisting of a single column, and the transpose
      of a vector behaves the same as a matrix consisting of a single row. Note that
      vectors may be rendered either as a single column or row.
    


    
      
        The vector element constructs vectors from an n-dimensional
    vector space so that its n child elements typically represent real or
    complex valued scalars as in the three-element vector

    This symbol is an n-ary constructor used to represent rows of matrices. Its arguments should be members of a ring.

        Note that the behavior of the matrix and matrixrow elements is
    substantially different from the mtable and mtr presentation
    elements.
      
    
    application
    This is the constructor for a matrix. It takes an arbitrary number matrix rows as arguments. It is used to represent matrices. See CRC Standard Mathematical Tables and Formulae, editor: Dan Zwillinger, CRC Press Inc., 1996, [2.5.1].

    
      The matrix constructor is used to represent mathematical matrices. It has zero or
    more child elements, all of which are matrixrows. These in turn expect zero or more
    child elements that evaluate to algebraic expressions or numbers. The
    matrixrow elements must always be contained inside of a matrix, and all rows
    in a given matrix must have the same number of elements.
