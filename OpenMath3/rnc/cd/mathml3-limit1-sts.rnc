     The copyright holder grants you permission to redistribute this 
     document freely as a verbatim copy. Furthermore, the copyright
     holder permits you to develop any derived work from this document
     provided that the following conditions are met.
       a) The derived work acknowledges the fact that it is derived from
          this document, and maintains a prominent reference in the 
          work to the original source.
       b) The fact that the derived work is not the original OpenMath 
          document is stated prominently in the derived work.  Moreover if
          both this document and the derived work are Content Dictionaries
          then the derived work must include a different CDName element,
          chosen so that it cannot be confused with any works adopted by
          the OpenMath Society.  In particular, if there is a Content 
          Dictionary Group whose name is, for example, `math' containing
          Content Dictionaries named `math1', `math2' etc., then you should 
          not name a derived Content Dictionary `mathN' where N is an integer.
          However you are free to name it `private_mathN' or some such.  This
          is because the names `mathN' may be used by the OpenMath Society
          for future extensions.
       c) The derived work is distributed under terms that allow the
          compilation of derived works, but keep paragraphs a) and b)
          intact.  The simplest way to do this is to distribute the derived
          work under the OpenMath license, but this is not a requirement.
     If you have questions about this license please contact the OpenMath
     society at http://www.openmath.org.

  This CD holds the basic notion of the limits functions of one variable whilst its variable tend (either from above, below or both sides) to a particular value.

      limit
    
    This symbol is used to denote the limit of a function. It takes 3 arguments: the limiting value of the argument, the method of approach (either null, above, below or both_sides) and the function.

    
      
        
           
           
            x
          
           
            0
          
           
            
            x
          
        
      
    
    

    
      
        
          
          
            x
          
           
             
              
              x
              0
            
           
           
            
            x
          
        
      
    

    
      
        
          
          
            x

    both_sides
    
      both_sides
    
    constant
    This symbol is used within a limit construct to show the limit is being approached from both sides. It cannot be applied.

    
  The limit of sin(x) as x tends to 0 from either direction
  
        
          
           0 
          
          
            
            
              
            
            
              
              
            
          
        
      
    
  
  
    above
    
      above
    
    constant
    This symbol is used within a limit construct to show the limit is being approached from above. It cannot be applied.

    
The limit of sin(x) as x tends to 0 from above

        
          
           0

      below
    
    constant
    This symbol is used within a limit construct to show the limit is being approached from below. It cannot be applied.

    
The limit of sin(x) as x tends to 0 from below

        
          
           0 
          
          
            
            
              
            
            
              
              
            
          
        
      
    
  
  
    null
    
      null

    This symbol is used within a limit construct to avoid specifying the method of approach to the limit. It cannot be applied.

    application
    This symbol is also used to express the relation that a quantity is tending to a specified value. While this is used primarily as part of the statement of a mathematical limit, it exists as a construct on its own to allow one to capture mathematical statements such as "As x tends to y," and to provide a building block to construct more general kinds of limits.

        To express that (x, y) tends to (f(x,
    y), g(x, y)), one might use vectors, as
    in:
      
      
        
          
          
            x
            y
          
           
             
              f
              x
              y
            
             
              g
              x
              y
