     The copyright holder grants you permission to redistribute this 
     document freely as a verbatim copy. Furthermore, the copyright
     holder permits you to develop any derived work from this document
     provided that the following conditions are met.
       a) The derived work acknowledges the fact that it is derived from
          this document, and maintains a prominent reference in the 
          work to the original source.
       b) The fact that the derived work is not the original OpenMath 
          document is stated prominently in the derived work.  Moreover if
          both this document and the derived work are Content Dictionaries
          then the derived work must include a different CDName element,
          chosen so that it cannot be confused with any works adopted by
          the OpenMath Society.  In particular, if there is a Content 
          Dictionary Group whose name is, for example, `math' containing
          Content Dictionaries named `math1', `math2' etc., then you should 
          not name a derived Content Dictionary `mathN' where N is an integer.
          However you are free to name it `private_mathN' or some such.  This
          is because the names `mathN' may be used by the OpenMath Society
          for future extensions.
       c) The derived work is distributed under terms that allow the
          compilation of derived works, but keep paragraphs a) and b)
          intact.  The simplest way to do this is to distribute the derived
          work under the OpenMath license, but this is not a requirement.
     If you have questions about this license please contact the OpenMath
     society at http://www.openmath.org.

    This CD holds symbols which describe both discrete and continuous
    1-dimensional intervals (with open/closed end points).




integer_interval
  
    integer_interval
  
application
 
A symbol to denote a discrete 1 dimensional interval from the first
argument to the second (inclusive), where the discretisation occurs at unit 
intervals. The arguments are the start and the end points of the interval
in that order.


The integer interval 1, 2, ..., 10.

interval
  
    interval
  
application
 
A symbol to denote a continuous 1-dimensional interval without any
information about the character of the end points (used in definite 
integration). The arguments are the start and the end points of the interval
in that order.




      
	This is the MathML constructor element for building an interval on the real line.
	While an interval can be expressed by combining relations appropriately, they
	occur here explicitly because of the frequency of their use.
      
    
    
      The interval element is used to represent simple mathematical intervals
      of the real number line.  It takes an attribute closure, which can take
      on any of the values open, closed,
      open-closed, or closed-open, with a default value
      of closed.
      A single interval element occuring as the second child of an
      apply element and preceded by one of the pre-defined n-ary operators is
      interpreted as a shorthand notation for a domainofapplication.  All other
      uses of an interval element as a child of an apply should be interpreted as
      ordinary function arguments unless otherwise dictated by the function
      definition.
      More general domains should be constructed using a domainofapplication
      element or one of the other shortcut notations described in .
      The interval element expects two child elements that evaluate to real
      numbers.  or one or more bvar elements and a child element
      that is a condition defining the interval.

      The interval element denotes an interval on the real line with the
      values represented by its children as end points. The closure attribute
      is used to qualify the type of interval being represented. For example,


  
    ab
    

      represents the open-closed interval often written (a,b].
