     The copyright holder grants you permission to redistribute this 
     document freely as a verbatim copy. Furthermore, the copyright
     holder permits you to develop any derived work from this document
     provided that the following conditions are met.
       a) The derived work acknowledges the fact that it is derived from
          this document, and maintains a prominent reference in the 
          work to the original source.
       b) The fact that the derived work is not the original OpenMath 
          document is stated prominently in the derived work.  Moreover if
          both this document and the derived work are Content Dictionaries
          then the derived work must include a different CDName element,
          chosen so that it cannot be confused with any works adopted by
          the OpenMath Society.  In particular, if there is a Content 
          Dictionary Group whose name is, for example, `math' containing
          Content Dictionaries named `math1', `math2' etc., then you should 
          not name a derived Content Dictionary `mathN' where N is an integer.
          However you are free to name it `private_mathN' or some such.  This
          is because the names `mathN' may be used by the OpenMath Society
          for future extensions.
       c) The derived work is distributed under terms that allow the
          compilation of derived works, but keep paragraphs a) and b)
          intact.  The simplest way to do this is to distribute the derived
          work under the OpenMath license, but this is not a requirement.
     If you have questions about this license please contact the OpenMath
     society at http://www.openmath.org.

    This CD defines the set functions and constructors for basic
    set theory. It is intended to be `compatible' with the
    corresponding elements in MathML.



 cartesian_product 
application

This symbol represents an n-ary construction function for constructing
the Cartesian product of sets. It takes n set arguments in order to
construct their Cartesian product.



An example to show the representation of the Cartesian product of sets: AxBxC.

  
    
    
    
    
  





emptyset
constant

This symbol is used to represent the empty set, that is the set which
contains no members. It takes no parameters.

 The intersection of A with the emptyset is the emptyset 


  
    
    
      
      
      
    
    
  



 The union of A with the emptyset is A 


  
    
    
      
      
      
    
    
  



 the size of the empty set is zero 



  
    
    
      
      
    
    
  





map
application

This symbol represents a mapping function which may be used to
construct sets, it takes as arguments a function from X to Y and a
set over X in that order. The value that is returned is a set of
values in Y. The argument list may be a set or an integer_interval.


The set of even values between 0 and 20, that is the values 2x, where
x ranges over the integral interval [0,10].

       0 
       10 
    
  





 size 
application
 
This symbol is used to denote the number of elements in a set. It is
either a non-negative integer, or an infinite cardinal number. The
symbol infinity may be used for an unspecified infinite cardinal.



The size of the set{3,6,9} = 3


  
    
    
      
      
        
         3 
         6 
         9 
      
    
     3 
  




The size of the set of integers is infinite


  
    
    
      
      
    
    
  





suchthat
application

This symbol represents the suchthat function which may be used to
construct sets, it takes two arguments. The first argument should be the
set which contains the elements of the set we wish to represent, the
second argument should be a predicate, that is a function from the set
to the booleans which describes if an element is to be in the set returned.


This example shows how to construct the set of even integers, using
the suchthat constructor.

  
    
    
    
      
      
        
      
      
        
	
	  
	  
	   2 
	
	
      
    
  





 set 
application
 
This symbol represents the set construct. It is an n-ary function. The
set entries are given explicitly. There is no implied ordering to the
elements of a set. 


The set {3, 6, 9}

  
    
     3 
     6 
     9 
  








 intersect 
application
 
This symbol is used to denote the n-ary intersection of sets. It takes
sets as arguments, and denotes the set that contains all the
elements that occur in all of them.


  (A intersect B) is a subset of A and (A intersect B) is a subset of B



  
    
    
      
      
        
	
	
      
      
    
    
      
      
        
	
	
      
      
    
  





 union 
application
 
This symbol is used to denote the n-ary union of sets. It takes
sets as arguments, and denotes the set that contains all the
elements that occur in any of them.


 A is a subset of (A union B) and B is a subset of (A union B) 



  
    
    
      
      
      
        
	
	
      
    
    
      
      
      
        
	
	
      
    
  




for all sets A,B and C

union(A,intersect(B,C)) = intersect(union(A,B),union(A,C))




  
    
    
      
      
      
    
    
      
      
        
        
        
          
          
          
        
      
      
        
        
          
          
          
        
        
          
          
          
        
      
        
  





 setdiff 
application
 
This symbol is used to denote the set difference of two sets. It takes
two sets as arguments, and denotes the set that contains all the
elements that occur in the first set, but not in the second.

first set is a proper subset of the second, that is a subset of the
second set but not actually equal to it.



A is a proper subset of B implies that A is a subset of B and A not= B
