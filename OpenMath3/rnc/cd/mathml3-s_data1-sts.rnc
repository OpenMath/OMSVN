     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

     The copyright holder grants you permission to redistribute this 
     document freely as a verbatim copy. Furthermore, the copyright
     holder permits you to develop any derived work from this document
     provided that the following conditions are met.
       a) The derived work acknowledges the fact that it is derived from
          this document, and maintains a prominent reference in the 
          work to the original source.
       b) The fact that the derived work is not the original OpenMath 
          document is stated prominently in the derived work.  Moreover if
          both this document and the derived work are Content Dictionaries
          then the derived work must include a different CDName element,
          chosen so that it cannot be confused with any works adopted by
          the OpenMath Society.  In particular, if there is a Content 
          Dictionary Group whose name is, for example, `math' containing
          Content Dictionaries named `math1', `math2' etc., then you should 
          not name a derived Content Dictionary `mathN' where N is an integer.
          However you are free to name it `private_mathN' or some such.  This
          is because the names `mathN' may be used by the OpenMath Society
          for future extensions.
       c) The derived work is distributed under terms that allow the
          compilation of derived works, but keep paragraphs a) and b)
          intact.  The simplest way to do this is to distribute the derived
          work under the OpenMath license, but this is not a requirement.
     If you have questions about this license please contact the OpenMath
     society at http://www.openmath.org.

    This CD holds the definitions of the basic statistical functions
    used on sample data. It is intended to be `compatible' with the
    MathML elements representing statistical functions, though it does
    not cover the concept of random variable which is mentioned in
    MathML.




mean
  
    mean
  
application
 
This symbol represents an n-ary function denoting the mean of its
arguments. That is, their sum divided by their number.



The mean of n arguments is their sum divided by their number

sdev
  
    sdev
  
application
 
This symbol represents a function requiring two or more arguments,
denoting the sample standard deviation of its arguments. That is,
the square root of (the sum of the squares of the deviations from the
mean of the arguments, divided by the number of arguments).
See CRC Standard Mathematical Tables and Formulae,
editor: Dan Zwillinger, CRC Press Inc., 1996, (7.7.11) section 7.7.1.



The square of the standard deviation of n arguments is the sum of
the squares of the differences from their mean divided by the number of
arguments.

variance
  
    variance
  
application

This symbol represents a function requiring two or more arguments,
denoting the variance of its arguments. That is, the square of the
standard deviation.


The variance of n arguments is the square of the standard deviation of
those arguments.

mode
  
    mode
  
application
 
This symbol represents an n-ary function denoting the mode of its
arguments. That is the value which occurs with the greatest frequency.


The mode of n arguments is that value which occurs with the greatest frequency.

 The mode of {1,1,2} is 1

median
  
    median
  
application
 
This symbol represents an n-ary function denoting the median of its
arguments. That is, if the data were placed in ascending order then it
denotes the middle one (in the case of an odd amount of data) or the
average of the middle two (in the case of an even amount of data).


 The median of {1,2,3} is 2

moment
  
    moment
  
application
 
This symbol is used to denote the i'th moment of a set of data. The
first argument should be the degree of the moment (that is, for the
i'th moment the first argument should be i), the second argument
should be the point about which the moment is being taken and the rest of the
arguments are treated as the data. For n data values x_1, x_2, ...,
x_n the i'th moment about c is (1/n) ((x_1-c)^i + (x_2-c)^i + ... + (x_n-c)^i).
See CRC Standard Mathematical Tables and Formulae,
editor: Dan Zwillinger, CRC Press Inc., 1996, section 7.7.1.


This is an example to denote the 2'nd moment of a set of data about
the origin.
