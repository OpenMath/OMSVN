# Discussion about CDName <-> dc:identifier on the OM3 mailing list
# * James Davenport (2008/02/26): This one I am slightly dubious about (for no
# good reason otehr than suspicion): CDname has an internal meaning for us -
# are you sure tehre aren't side-effects?
#
# * Christoph Lange (2008/02/26):
# Choosing the right data type (or in
# ontology-speak, range of property) here has two aspects IMHO, which I'll try
# to comment on:
#
# * what you intend to express/represent
# * what formal types are available to choose from
#
# Section 2.3 of the OM 2 standard doesn't tell much about the intended purpose
# and the internal meaning of names in OpenMath. It does restrict the range of
# this property to the XML data type NCName, and this is indeed a bit more
# specific than the range of the property dc:identifier. The latter is defined
# as rdfs:Literal (see
# http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/#terms-identifier), which in turn
# is specified as follows (http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_literal):
#
# > The class rdfs:Literal is the class of literal values such as strings and
# > integers. Property values such as textual strings are examples of RDF
# > literals. Literals may be plain or typed. A typed literal is an instance of
# > a datatype class. This specification does not define the class of plain
# > literals.
#
# That is, it can be typed (but optionally), but I think for OpenMath we could
# prescribe literals typed as NCName in any place where names are expected.
#
# On the other hand, the intended purpose of dc:identifier matches the meaning
# of OpenMath names, as I understand it, quite well
# (http://dublincore.org/documents/dcmi-terms/#terms-identifier):
#
# >   Definition:   An unambiguous reference to the resource within a given
# > context.
# > Comment:   Recommended best practice is to identify the resource
# > by means of a string conforming to a formal identification system.
#
# * Paul Libbrecht (2008/02/26):
# Finally, I think that currently CDName + CDBase gives the identifier... so your mapping is a bit incomplete.
#
# * Michael Kohlhase (2008/02/27):
# I think that Paul is right, that the identifier is CDName + CDBase, so we should not do that substitution, but we can add a dc:identifier element that concatenates both and makes processing for external applications simpler. We could even mandate that  the vales of dc:identifier and CDName and CDBase have this relation (though not in the Schema I am afraid).
#
# For the other tags I think that the meaning stays the same, and changing to the Dublin Core tagset would be safe. The next question would be whether we only want only to substitute/reinterpret only the existing metadata entries or whether we would like to allow the whole DC tagset. As I said before, both seem to be covered wrt. backwards compatibility.
