This is the OpenMath document ontology, a vocabulary for structures from
OpenMath Content Dictionaries (CDs) that is suitable for use with Semantic Web tools.

== Motivation ==

This ontology is intended to represent knowledge from OpenMath CDs in a way
that abstracts from the XML syntax of the CD language.  Furthermore, it
captures more of the semantics of the CD language than the Relax NG XML schema
is capable of.

The ontology is currently utilised in the OpenMath CD wiki at
http://wiki.openmath.org.  The background is motivated in the following
publication:
http://kwarc.info/projects/swim/pubs/semwiki08-notation-semantics.pdf

== Status ==

The current state (version 0.1.1 as of 2008/06/23) represents most of the
OpenMath CD language as specified for OpenMath 2, but includes notation
dictionaries as planned for OpenMath 3.  Further development will be done
towards OpenMath 3.

== Files ==

The *.n3 file is the authoritative source.  The *.owl file (RDF/XML) is
generated from that.  The N3 syntax is easier to author for humans, whereas
RDF/XML is more widely supported by software.  rdfcat from Jena
(http://jena.sourceforge.net) is a tool that can do this conversion:

$ rdfcat -out RDF/XML -n openmath.n3 > openmath.owl

== Usage ==

You can use this ontology in conjunction with OpenMath CDs or without.  If used
together with CDs, we recommend using the Krextor library
(http://kwarc.info/projects/krextor/) for extracting RDF in terms of this
ontology from your XML CD files.  If used without CD files, the ontology can
serve as an alternative language for representing (part of) the knowledge that
can be captured in CDs.
