In order to produce xhtml from the sources using the ANT build.xml file
distributed you need to: 
	- have java (tested on j2sdk1.4.2_02)
	- have ANT  (tested on apache-ant-1.6.1)
	- have the standard docbook stylesheets (tested on xsl-stylesheets-1.61.2)
	- set the environment variable DOCBOOK_XSL to your local
	version of the docbook stylesheets, 
	e.g.  setenv DOCBOOK_XSL /usr/share/xml/docbook/xsl-stylesheets-1.61.2


The default ANT target will use the stylesheet $DOCBOOK_XSL/xhtml/chunk.xsl 
and include in the local stylesheet src/xsl/primer.xsl where customization
is to be found. The style for rendering is stored in src/xsl/primer.css.
The command to invoke is:
	ant chunk or ant

and it produces the html in build/obj/xhtml.
