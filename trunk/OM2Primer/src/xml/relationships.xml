        <para>There is a strong relationship to the MathML recommendation
    <citation>MathML_98</citation> from the Worldwide Web Consortium,
    and a large overlap between the two developer communities.  MathML
    deals principally with the <emphasis>presentation</emphasis> of
    mathematical objects, while &OM; is solely concerned with their
    semantic meaning or <emphasis>content</emphasis>.  While MathML
    does have some limited facilities for dealing with content, it
    also allows semantic information encoded in &OM; to be embedded
    inside a MathML structure.  Thus the two technologies may be seen
    as highly complementary.</para>
