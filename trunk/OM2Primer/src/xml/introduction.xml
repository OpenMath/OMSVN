      <title>Introduction</title> <para>&OM; is a standard for
      representing mathematical objects, allowing them to be exchanged
      between computer programs, stored in databases, or published on
      the worldwide web.  The original designers were mainly
      developers of computer algebra systems interested in a mechanism
      that would allow using third party computational software on
      their mathematical objects. The world wide web development
      opened the way for a much broader usage of a portable
      representation of mathematics. &OM; has a close relationship
      with &MML;, the W3C recommendation for web mathematics,
      described further in <xref linkend="mml"/>.

      <para>A novice user of &OM; most likely has come across an
      <emphasis>encoding</emphasis> of an &OM;
      <emphasis>object</emphasis> or of a <emphasis>Content
      Dictionary</emphasis>. To understand the encoding however, one
      must be aware of the abstract information model underlying &OM;
      objects and Content Dictionaries. </para>
