\section*{TODO}
Co-ordination actions are meant to complement other Framework
Programme instruments in contributing toward integrating research at
european level through well-planned networking or coordination
activities.

This means, we need to list to which projects we are adding bells and
whistles.

GOAL: This document should become the big-picture visionary paper to
rally the OM crowd around for the next part of the OM initiative.  We
need a \emph{new vision} that can be sold to the OM crowd (target 1)
and funding bodies (target 2).


\section{Introduction}

The ability to use computers for performing mathematical tasks is
undoubtedly one of the key factors behind recent progress in science,
engineering, and economics.  New technology such as the computational
grid and the semantic web could provide the infrastructure which will
allow researchers to make even greater leaps forward by enhancing
collaboration and providing instant access to massive computational
resources.  On a smaller scale, web service technology holds out the
promise of better interaction between mathematical applications within
a particular community.

These visions rely on the ability to move data and mathematical
objects between pieces of software, and this in turn requires a
mechanism for describing the meaning of those objects.  This issue was
addressed in the Fifth Framework OpenMath and OpenMath Thematic
Network projects, in cooperation with the Worldwide Web Consortium's
(W3C) Math Working Group.  The result is two complementary
standards~--- OpenMath and MathML~--- which allow mathematical objects
to be transmitted and processed by computers in a mathematically
meaningful way, as well as rendered in the current generation of web
browsers.

The coordination action focuses on strenghtening OpenMath support for
mathematical communication in the scientific, engineering, and
economics communities, and on supporting European involvement in the
newly-chartered W3C Math Interest Group.  The coordination action will
sponsor activities such as

\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item the enhancement and strengthening of the community of OpenMath
  users;
\item further evolution of the OpenMath vocabulary;
\item tailoring OpenMath for use as a technology within the semantic
  web;
\item the development of web and grid services which communicate via
  OpenMath;
\item the development of tools for OpenMath developers.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Strengthening the OpenMath Community} 
\label{community}

%This task is at the core of the coordination action since it aims at
%strenghtening the user base of OpenMath by promoting Content
%Dictionaries. Dissemination and training, setting up editorial board
%for CDs, ....


%% I think that it would be good to have a section after the introduction
%% describing the existing OpenMath Community.  This could be structured as
%% follows:
%% - Mathematical Software (NAG, ORCCA/Maple, Axiom, Cocoa ...)
%% - Mathematical Publishing (OMDoc, Algebra Interactive, NAG)
%% - E-Learning (Eindhoven, LeActiveMath, Helsinki)
%% - Semantic Web (MONET, Stilo)
%% - Web Services (MONET, ORCCA/Maple)
%% Obviously the more groups and the wider the coverage of topics the
%% better.  We might want to think about who we could bring "into the fold"
%% as well.



As a result of the previous projects there is now a broad community of
people using OpenMath in a variety of ways.  Activities in the areas
of publishing, e-learning, web services and conventional mathematical
software are all in progress.  The main aim of this task is to provide
a basic infrastructure in which these groups can collaborate, This
includes providing web-based and hands-on training, supporting mailing
lists and organising regular workshops.

\subsection{Mathematical Software}
\label{sec:msw}
%% - Mathematical Software (NAG, ORCCA/Maple, Axiom, Cocoa ...)

The original and primary target user group for OpenMath was the
community of mathematical users and developers. OpenMath has been
developed with the intent of supporting easy interfacing of
mathematical software packages with different yet compatible
functionalities. Examples of systems that speak OpenMath include
AXIOM, Aldor, Maple, REDUCE, CoCoA, and NAG's Fortran library (?).

%what to do to strenghten this community
The coordination action intends to strenghten this community by adding
more visibility to the OpenMath compliant software via the web page,
by collecting and disseminating guidelines for implementors and by
active support for the upgrade to OpenMath version 2.0.

\subsection{Mathematical Publishing}
\label{sec:mpubl}
%% - Mathematical Publishing (OMDoc, Algebra Interactive, NAG)

The mathematical publishing community broadly intended includes
publishing companies of scientific literature, software companies
distributing documentation and training material, down to the
researchers that distribute results and lectures online.

Publishers of mathematical books are interested in the inclusion of
OpenMath in the electronic version of the texts because it enhances
interactivity: with a mouse click, a mathematical object can be
transferred to a program that computes with it or maybe produces a
graph to visualize it. 

\subsection{E-Learning}
\label{sec:e-learn}
%% - E-Learning (Eindhoven, LeActiveMath, Helsinki)


\subsection{Semantic Web}
\label{sec:semw}
%% - Semantic Web (MONET, Stilo)


\subsection{Web Services}
\label{sec:ws}
%% - Web Services (MONET, ORCCA/Maple,RISC)





The W3C Math Working group was recently dissolved, after completing an
editorial revision of MathML.  MathML is a format for describing both
the presentation and content of mathematical objects, and is designed
to support OpenMath as a content descriptor.  A new Math Interest
Group has been set up by W3C to support users of MathML, and an
important aspect of this task will be to support European involvement
in it.  One of the members of this Consortium, NAG Ltd, provides one
of the co-chairs of the Math Interest Group.

\section{Evolving the OpenMath Vocabulary}
\label{sec:OCD}

The mathematical knowledge is provided in OpenMath by means of
symbols, defined in `OpenMath Content Dictionaries' (CDs).  OpenMath
Content Dictionaries make available mathematical definitions and
symbols in an extensible, machine-readible way.

For OpenMath to become widespread it is important to have a critical
mass of CDs. This task is centered on identifying and producing CDs
for those areas of mathematics which are not yet supported by either
MathML or OpenMath. The mathematical content will be represented in
CDs and these CDs will be implemented in one or more software packages
to demonstrate their usefulness.

Special attention will be devoted to CDs linked to 
\begin{itemize}
  
\item computational software packages which decides to become part of
  the OpenMath community by for instance implementing a OpenMath
  \texttt{export} facility (Maple, Axiom, Singular, CoCoA, Macaulay2,
  \ldots)
  
\item projects that use and/or extend OpenMath (LeActiveMath, MONET,
  Algebra Interactive, \ldots)
  
\item computationally relevant fields ranging from NIST digital
  library of mathematical functions to the problem of matrix-group
  recognition.

\end{itemize}

\section{OpenMath inside the Semantic Web}

W3C is developing tools that will support the next generation
\emph{semantic} web where information is encoded in such a way that its
meaning is unambiguous and where software agents can process and reason
with it on behalf of human users.  The MONET project experimented with
using OpenMath inside the Web Ontology Language so that a software
component could make decisions by reasoning about OpenMath objects.

This task will continue to investigate the integration of OpenMath into
the semantic web.  One aspect of this is to allow OpenMath objects to be
manipulated by semantic web tools, as was done in MONET.  Another is to
develop the concept of Content Dictionaries so that the information
contained within them can be processed by sophisticated tools such as
proof assistants and theorem provers.

\section{Web and Grid Services}


\section{CD Tools Development} 
\label{tools}

This task realises the need for tools to facilitate the creation and
usage of CDs. Activities that develop editors, stylesheets, validation
mechanisms, archiving and searching facilities fall under this task.
