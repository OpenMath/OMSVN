\section*{TODO}
Co-ordination actions are meant to complement other Framework Programme
instruments in contributing toward integrating reasdearch at european level
through well-planned netwokring or coordination activities.

This means, we need to list to which projects we are adding bells and whistles.

\section{Introduction}
%%%% some prose 
%sketches the scene: application areas of OM
The ability to use computers for performing mathematical tasks has undoubtedly
been one of the key factors of recent progress in science, engineering,
and economics. 
Further
%Even if it might seem that no further 
advances can be
expected in the electronic processing of mathematics
from emerging web technologies.
They will once
more revolutionize the way we do and use computer mathematics.

%mentions the need for OM
As scientists, engineers, and economists become more
dependent on computers in their daily activities, the
mathematical tasks they perform grow more sophisticated. Supporting
this trend involves a constant improvement in the software, in the
interfaces, but also in the way mathematics is represented
electronically. Collaborative problem solving, mathematical web
services, the grid, and e-learning notes are only a few of the activities that
greatly benefit from a semantical mark-up of mathematics. 

Mathematical knowledge representation is an old problem dating back to
..., however first the computers, and now the world wide web add
several new challenges to what seemed to be a solved issue.

%%% list the challenges
The shift towards doing mathematics on the Internet has emphasized the
need for a portable, extensible, reusable and shareable format for
expressing mathematical objects.

%% MATHML
This need has been recognized some years ago both by the World Wide
Web Consortium and by the European Community. 

%% OpenMath from MKM proposal
%% 
OpenMath is a standard for representing mathematical formulae,
allowing them to be exchanged between computer programs, stored in
databases, or published on the world-wide web.  While the original
designers were mainly developers of computer algebra systems, it is
now attracting interest from other areas of scientific computation and
from many publishers of electronic documents with a significant
mathematical content. 



%Unfortunately, not all items of mathematical knowledge are simple
%formulae: a typical theorem of calculus might be ``If $(a_n)$ and
%$(b_n)$ are two convergent sequences, then $(a_n+b_n)$ is also a
%convergent sequence.'' This can only be converted into a single
%formula by unpacking all the definitions, which would lead to massive
%growth in the formulae, as well as unreadability, as one tackled more
%complicated enunciations. The OMDoc\footnote{{\tt
%    http:/www.mathweb.org/omdoc}.  The author of OMDoc is in the
%  consortium.}  mechanism is an attempt to extend OpenMath to cover
%these sorts of concepts and contexts. It is clear that more work will
%need to be done on Knowledge Representation.


The coordination action focuses on strenghtening the OpenMath support for
mathematical communication in scientific, engineering, and economics
communities.  The coordination action will sponsor
activities such as
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item the enhancement and strengthening of the community of OpenMath
users;
\item the further development of both content and format of mathematical symbol definitions, adding
further structure to the semantic web;
\item the development of tools to facilitate using OpenMath on the Web and in
computational grids.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Strengthening of the OpenMath Community} 
\label{community}

This task is at the core of the coordination action since it aims at
strenghtening the user base of OpenMath by promoting Content
Dictionaries. Dissemination and training, setting up editorial board
for CDs, ....


\section{Content Dictionaries}
\label{sec:OCD}



The mathematical knowledge is provided in OpenMath by means of symbols,
defined in `OpenMath Content Dictionaries' (OCDs).  
OpenMath Content Dictionaries make available mathematical definitions and
symbols in an extensible, machine-readible way. To a limited extent,
CDs are also machine understood and the definitions, properties, and
theorems can be processed by theorem proving software.

In describing what needs to be done regarding OCDs, we
distinguish between format development and further production.


\subsection{OCD Format Development}
\label{format}
This task concentrates on refining the formalism used for CDs, already revised
in OpenMath 2.0, and giving exact usage guidelines on how applications should
understand CDs.

For instance compliance of applications.



Here feedback from user community will be important.


\subsection{CD Content Development} 
\label{content}
For OpenMath to become widespread it is important to have
critical mass of Content Dictionaries. This task is centered on
identifying and producing CDs for those areas of mathematics which are
not yet supported by neither MathML nor OpenMath. The mathematical
content will be represented in CDs and these CDs will be implemented
in one or more software packages as further demonstrate the
effectivity of the approach. 

Special attention will be devoted to CDs linked to 
\begin{itemize}
\item computational software packages which decides to become part of the
OpenMath community by for instance implementing a OpenMath
\texttt{export} facility (Singular,CoCoA, Macaulay2 come to mind)

\item projects that use and/or extend OpenMath (LeActiveMath, MONET
  and related come to mind)
  
\item computationally relevant fields ranging from NIST digital
  library of mathematical functions to the problem of matrix-group
  recognition.
\end{itemize}


\section{CD Tools Development} 
\label{tools}
This task realizes the need for tools to facilitate the creation and
usage of CDs. Activities that develop editors, stylesheets, validation
mechanisms, archiving and searching facilities falls under this task.
In particular, this task will combine the above tools towards the
creation of a the mathematical knowledge base of OpenMath CDs as a .




\chapter{Work Plan}
We define a work plan containing a
whole range of medium- to long-term types of networking or co-ordination
activities.
\begin{itemize}
\item
Performance of studies, analyses, benchmarking exercises;

test sets for  solving simple problems phrased in OM


\item
exchange and dissemination of information

\item exchange and dissemination of good practices

exchanging phrasebooks from oine package to another.

Sharing OCDs.
Test each on 3 applications / software systems

\item exchanges of personnel;

offer young researchers for writing phrasebooks;

(small  budget)


\item 
organisation of conference, seminar and meetings;

OpenMath workshop series, and satellites for ISSAC or similar, and possibly
further out, eg economics.

Combine with MathML?

\item 
setting up of common information systems;

all the data base, knowledge base repository of OCDs

connections with MKM?

Expand and maintain www.openmath.org at NAG


\item 
setting up of expert groups;

one of these: makers of CAS systems, involved in phrasebooks for
particular sets of OCDs.

editorial board for OCD submission, editing, validation, etc.

\item 
definition, organisation and management of joint or common initiatives.
