\end{quote}

\section*{TO KEEP IN MIND}
Co-ordination actions are meant to complement other Framework
Programme instruments in contributing toward integrating research at
european level through well-planned networking or coordination
activities.

This means, we need to list to which projects we are adding bells and
whistles.

GOAL: This document should become the big-picture visionary paper to
rally the OM crowd around for the next part of the OM initiative.  We
need a \emph{new vision} that can be sold to the OM crowd (target 1)
and funding bodies (target 2).


\section{Introduction}

The ability to use computers for performing mathematical tasks is
undoubtedly one of the key factors behind recent progress in science,
engineering, and economics.  New technology such as the computational
grid and the semantic web could provide the infrastructure which will
allow researchers to make even greater leaps forward by enhancing
collaboration and providing instant access to massive computational
resources.  On a smaller scale, web service technology holds out the
promise of better interaction between mathematical applications within
a particular community.

These visions rely on the ability to move data and mathematical
objects between pieces of software, and this in turn requires a
mechanism for describing the meaning of those objects.  This issue was
addressed in the Fifth Framework OpenMath and OpenMath Thematic
Network projects, in cooperation with the Worldwide Web Consortium's
(W3C) Math Working Group.  The result is two complementary
standards~--- OpenMath and MathML~--- which allow mathematical objects
to be transmitted and processed by computers in a mathematically
meaningful way, as well as rendered in the current generation of web
browsers.

The coordination action focuses on strenghtening OpenMath support for
mathematical communication in the scientific, engineering, and
economics communities, and on supporting European involvement in the
newly-chartered W3C Math Interest Group.  The coordination action will
sponsor activities such as

\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item the enhancement and strengthening of the community of OpenMath
  users;
\item further evolution of the OpenMath vocabulary;
\item tailoring OpenMath for use as a technology within the semantic
  web;
\item the development of web and grid services which communicate via
  OpenMath;
\item the development of tools for OpenMath developers.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Strengthening the OpenMath Community} 
\label{community}


As a result of the previous projects there is now a broad community of
people using OpenMath in a variety of ways.  Activities in the areas
of publishing, e-learning, web services and conventional mathematical
software are all in progress.  The main aim of this task is to provide
a basic infrastructure in which these groups can collaborate, This
includes providing web-based and hands-on training, supporting mailing
lists and organising regular workshops.

This task is at the core of the coordination action since it aims at
strenghtening the user base of OpenMath by promoting Content
Dictionaries. Dissemination and training, setting up editorial board
for CDs, expert consulting, easy to follow and good practise
guidelines.


% I think that it would be good to have a section after the introduction
% describing the existing OpenMath Community.  This could be structured as
% follows:
% - Mathematical Software (NAG, ORCCA/Maple, Axiom, Cocoa ...)
% - Mathematical Publishing (OMDoc, Algebra Interactive, NAG)
% - E-Learning (Eindhoven, LeActiveMath, Helsinki)
% - Semantic Web (MONET, Stilo)
% - Web Services (MONET, ORCCA/Maple)
% Obviously the more groups and the wider the coverage of topics the
% better.  We might want to think about who we could bring "into the fold"
% as well.



\subsection{Mathematical Software}
\label{sec:msw}
% - Mathematical Software (NAG, ORCCA/Maple, Axiom, Cocoa ...)

The original and primary target user group for OpenMath was the
community of mathematical users and developers. OpenMath has been
developed with the intent of supporting easy interfacing of
mathematical software packages with different yet compatible
functionalities. 

Examples of systems that speak OpenMath include AXIOM, Aldor, Maple,
REDUCE, CoCoA, and NAG's Fortran library (?).

%what to do to strenghten this community 
The coordination action intends to strenghten this community by adding
more visibility to the OpenMath compliant software via the web page,
by collecting and disseminating guidelines for implementors, by active
support for the upgrade to OpenMath version 2.0, by the development
and exchange of Content Dictionaries and Phrasebooks.

\subsection{Mathematical Publishing}
\label{sec:mpubl}
% - Mathematical Publishing (OMDoc, Algebra Interactive, NAG)

The mathematical publishing community broadly includes publishing
companies of scientific literature, software companies distributing
documentation and training material, down to the researchers that
distribute results and lectures online.

Publishers of mathematical books are interested in the inclusion of
OpenMath in electronic versions of texts because it enhances
interactivity: with a mouse click, a mathematical object can be
transferred to a computational program or to visualization software.
The same reason holds true for OpenMath to be incorporated in other
publishing activities: the mathematics in published material becomes
truly interactive whether it is demonstrating usage of third-party
algorithms or giving hands-on examples to students.

The publishing community can follow the examples set by Algebra
Interactive, by OMDoc activities and by NAG (hypertextual
documentation?).

%what to do to strenghten this community
The coordination action intends to strenghten this community by
supporting activities such as NIST's Digital Library of Mathematical
Functions\footnote{\url{http://www.openmath.org/cocoon/openmath//meetings/helsinki2004/Miller/slides.pdf}},
collect tools that simplify inclusion of OpenMath in published
material, include OpenMath in accepted formats such as
DocBook\ednote{Please think about this}


\subsection{E-Learning}
\label{sec:e-learn}
% - E-Learning (Eindhoven, LeActiveMath, Helsinki)
Novel usage of OpenMath comes from the e-learning community. To
e-learning developers, OpenMath offers the advantage of being a rather
simple language for the representation of mathematics that
standardizes the various notations used in computational software
systems. Authors can produce electronic lectures in a format that can
be visualized on the screen, read out automatically or printed. The
same source may be used to produce handouts of specific lesson-trails
or dynamically adapted to the user profile. The mathematical
expressions can be directly fed to a variety of software packages and
to mathematical web services.

(Eindhoven, LeActiveMath, Helsinki)

%what to do to strenghten this community
The coordination action intends to strenghten this community by
increasing dissemination in relevant conferences (IMACS-ACA,
technology conference in mathematics), by producing easy-to-follow
examples, by enlarging the numer of authors to scientific and
engineering fields.



\subsection{Semantic Web}
\label{sec:semw}
% - Semantic Web (MONET, Stilo)


\subsection{Web Services}
\label{sec:ws}
% - Web Services (MONET, ORCCA/Maple,RISC)

% Rewritten from MKM proposal
The increasingly popular Web Service paradigm can be used in the
mathematical context to offer controlled access to literature
information, e.g. journal articles, or to databases, e.g. integral
tables, or to offer access to computational resources, e.g.
differential equation solvers, theorem provers, statistical packages.
Evidence from the EU MONET project (IST-2001-34145) suggests that true
advertisement and discovery of mathematical services requires a
significant amount of mathematical infrastructure to be constructed
and maintained beyond that offered by the web service technologies
used in industry.  The MONET framework uses a layered approach for the
mathematical parts of the service description, the \emph{Mathematical
  Service Description Language} (MSDL) in which the mathematical
fragments of the descriptions heavily rely on OpenMath.  The ultimate
goal is for a user to be able to state requirements specifically
(``solve $\int_0^\pi{}\sin(x)\,dx$'') or generically (``find me an
available service which performs definite integration and costs
nothing for me to use'') and a mathematical broker to find the
suitable services that match the request.

Web service technology is a fundamental development towards
distributed collaboration on the computational grid (often called
\emph{e-science}).  

% from MKM proposal
%In this network we will seek to build on the work of the MONET project
%by developing and maintaining standards for mathematical service
%description.  We will run a public registry of mathematical services
%along with the necessary Problem and Algorithm Description Libraries.
%Where it makes sense we will deploy tools developed elsewhere in the
%project, for example translators between different semantic and
%presentation representations such as OpenMath and MathML, as web
%services.

%In addition, as new web service technologies evolve or are
%standardized by bodies such as the Worldwide Web Consortium and OASIS,
%we will seek to form standard mechanisms by which they can be
%integrated into the semantic discovery approach described above.  For
%example, at the time of writing this proposal, there is no single
%approach to \emph{web service choreography}, i.e.~the problem of
%describing how you combine a number of services to solve a single
%problem.  Describing a mathematical solution process differs from
%describing a generic business process in that the choice of
%intermediate services will very often depend on properties of the
%results returned by previous services, so any generic mechanism may
%need some adaption or enhancement to be useful in our context.




\subsection{Markup Languages}
\label{sec:ml}
% - Web Services (MathML, CML)

The user community of markup languages is growing every day and has
the potential of becoming a large user group for OpenMath, should it
be adopted as the markup language of mathematics inside scientific,
engineering and commercial markups (see the recent workshop
\url{http://scimarkuplang.comm.nsdlib.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl}).

MathML is a format for describing both the presentation and content of
mathematical objects, and is designed to support OpenMath as a content
descriptor.  The W3C Math Working group was recently dissolved, after
completing an editorial revision of MathML.  A new Math Interest Group
has been set up by W3C to support users of MathML, and an important
aspect of this task will be to support European involvement in it.
One of the members of this Consortium, NAG Ltd, provides one of the
co-chairs of the Math Interest Group.

CML, chemical markup language and STMML, scientific, technical and
medical a markup language, RoboML, Robotic Markup Language, are at
present a few examples of markup langauges that only support OpenMath
indirectly through MathML.  Public awareness will increase by crafting
examples in these langages which are representable in MathML only by
resorting to OpenMath CDs.

\section{Evolving the OpenMath Vocabulary}
\label{sec:OCD}

The mathematical knowledge is provided in OpenMath by means of
symbols, defined in `OpenMath Content Dictionaries' (CDs).  OpenMath
Content Dictionaries make available mathematical definitions and
symbols in an extensible, machine-readible way.

For OpenMath to become widespread it is important to have a critical
mass of CDs. This task is centered on identifying and producing CDs
for those areas of mathematics which are not yet supported by either
MathML or OpenMath. The mathematical content will be represented in
CDs and these CDs will be implemented in one or more software packages
to demonstrate their usefulness.

Special attention will be devoted to CDs linked to 
\begin{itemize}
  
\item computational software packages which decides to become part of
  the OpenMath community by for instance implementing a OpenMath
  \texttt{export} facility (Maple, Axiom, Singular, CoCoA, Macaulay2,
  \ldots)
  
\item projects that use and/or extend OpenMath (LeActiveMath, MONET,
  Algebra Interactive, \ldots)
  
\item computationally relevant fields ranging from NIST digital
  library of mathematical functions to the problem of matrix-group
  recognition.

\end{itemize}

\section{OpenMath inside the Semantic Web}

W3C is developing tools that will support the next generation
\emph{semantic} web where information is encoded in such a way that
its meaning is unambiguous and where software agents can process and
reason with it on behalf of human users.  The MONET project
experimented with using OpenMath inside the Web Ontology Language so
that a software component could make decisions by reasoning about
OpenMath objects.

This task will continue to investigate the integration of OpenMath
into the semantic web.  One aspect of this is to allow OpenMath
objects to be manipulated by semantic web tools, as was done in MONET.
Another is to develop and further refine the concept of Content
Dictionaries so that the information contained within them can be
processed by sophisticated tools such as proof assistants and theorem
provers.

\section{Web and Grid Services}


\section{CD Tools Development} 
\label{tools}

This task realises the need for tools to facilitate the creation and
usage of CDs. Activities that develop editors, stylesheets, validation
mechanisms, archiving and searching facilities fall under this task.
