\chapter{Project Objectives}

The original objectives of the OpenMath Thematic Network were as
follows:

\begin{itemize}

\item To support European involvement in the evolution of MathML and
OpenMath and coordinate the development of tools, in particular XSL
style-sheets, to render OpenMath into MathML for use in Web browsers and
other MathML-enabled applications.

\item To provide support and advice for developers of OpenMath and
MathML applications.

\item To continue the evolution of the OpenMath standard and its Content
Dictionaries.

\item To educate and inform interested parties about the technology for
mathematics on the Web through Project Workshops.

\end{itemize}
