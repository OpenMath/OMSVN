\chapter{Conclusions}

The project has successfully fostered an OpenMath community and allowed
us to update OpenMath in line with recent developments.  The emergence
of browsers which support XSLT and Presentation MathML has been of great
benefit to us, as has the widespread adoption of XML in mathematical
packages such as Matlab, Maple and Mathematica.

There is still work to be done.  In particular we need:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Education and training materials to speed-up the adoption of
OpenMath.
\item Still more Content Dictionaries to broaden the vocabulary
available to OpenMath applications,
\end{enumerate}

Looking further forward, the increased interest in a ``semantic web''
ought to provide us with new opportunities to increase the take-up of
OpenMath.  The MONET project has already shown that it is possible to
encode information about OpenMath symbols in an OWL ontology, and use
that information to reason about the meaning of OpenMath objects.
Encoding Content Dictionaries in OWL or RDF would perhaps make the
information in them accessible to semantic web applications.    

We hope that all these issues will be addressed by a future project.
